	23: telnet
	25: SMTP = simple mail transfer protocol

            <h1>What is the IP address of studypoints.dk and how did you find it?
Ip: 165.227.137.75 I used the command ping however tracert and pathping could also be used.
</h1><br>
            <h1>If you write https://studypoints.dk in your browser, how did “it” figure out that it should go to the IP address you discovered above?
Utilizing DNS which finds the name and translate the ip.
</h1><br>
            <h1>Explain shortly the purpose of an ip-address and a port-number and why we need both
Ips are assigned to local computers on a network. And ports are used to identify the IP

            <h1>Explain (conceptually) about the TCP/IP-protocol stack
The TCP/IP protocol stack contains several layers, the lowest layer deals with hardware communications and then the higher you go the more advance the overall program gets since one or more new feature is generally added for each layer
</h1><br>
            <h1>Explain about the HTTP Protocol (the following exercises will go much deeper into this protocol)
I’m a bit uncertain about this question so please do contact me if you expect something else.
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (which renders the Protocol in the question unnecessary)  HTTP is a request - response protocol functioning between a Client and a Server. 
</h1><br>
            <h1>Explain (conceptually) how HTTP and TCP/IP are connected (what can HTTP do, and where does it fit into TCP/IP)
HTTP client attempts to establish TCP connection to a port of the HTTP server it wishes to connect to. TCP/IP allows the HTTP client and server to transfer information between them.
